Starting a new project
===============================================================================


Create a new project from the template
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Choose where you would like to create your new project, and call copier with 
the template.

.. important::
    A new version of Copier was released June 4, 2023. Please ensure that your
    installed version of Copier >= 8.0.0. The following command will not work
    with earlier versions of Copier.

    ``pipx list`` will display the currently installed version of Copier.

.. code-block:: bash

    >> copier copy gh:lincc-frameworks/python-project-template <new/project/directory>

Copier will ask you questions for how to set up the project. These questions 
will be used to fill in aspects of the project's configuration, including both 
metadata and parameters. Below we provide some high-level overview of the 
questions:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Question**
     - **Notes**
   * - *Would you like to use simple (default tooling) or customized installation?*
     - If a simple install is used, the template automatically selects the recommended tooling options (linter, isort, and create example module). 
   * - *What is the name of your project?*
     - The name of your project. If you distribute your code via PyPI, this is the name that will be used. This will allow users to pip install like so: ``pip install <project_name>``. The project name must start with a lowercase letter, followed by one or more of the following (a-z, 0-9, _, -).
   * - *What is your python package name?*
     - The name of your top level package. Specifies the location of the source code (``src/{{package_name}}``). The package name must start with a lowercase letter, followed by one or more of the following (a-z, 0-9, _).
   * - *Your first and last name?* 
     -  The name of code's author. This will be used in the project and documentation metadata. This name will also be included as part of the copyright license.
   * - *Your preferred email address?*
     - The contact email for the code's author. This will be used in the project and documentation metadata.
   * - *What license would you like to use?*
     - The license type you want to use for this project. Options are MIT and BSD. For more information on these options see `Github's license page <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository>`_.
   * - *What tooling would you like to use to enforce code style?*
     - A linter is a tool to automatically format for consistency (see :doc:`Linting <../practices/linting>`). We provide options for `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, `pylint <https://pypi.org/project/pylint/>`_, or no linter. Choosing a linter will include it as a project dependency and include it in the :doc:`pre-commit <../practices/precommit>` hooks. Defaults to ``pylint`` during simple installation. 
   * - *Do you want to use isort to maintain a specific ordering for module imports?*
     - `isort <https://pycqa.github.io/isort/>`_ is a tool for ordering imports in a standard order. Enabling the option will include ``isort`` as part of github's :doc:`pre-commit <../practices/precommit>`. Defaults to ``True`` during simple installation.
   * - *Would you like to include mypy to perform static type checking for type hints?*
     - `mypy <https://www.mypy-lang.org>`_ performs static type checking on python code that uses `type hints <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html>`_. This type checking makes sure that the correct data types are being used where type hints are defined. If basic or strict type checking is selected, a pre-commit hook and GitHub actions workflow that perform the type checking are added. Basic type checking performs type checks but ignores code or imports for which type hints are not written. Strict type checking enforces type hints are used by giving errors where no type hints are found.
   * - *Do you want to create some example module code?*
     - If this option is selected the template will create an example module ``src/{{package_name}}/example_module.py`` and test file ``tests/{{package_name}}/test_example_module.py``. Defaults to ``True`` during simple installation.
   * - *Do you want to include rendered notebooks in your documentation?*
     - The requirements to host rendered notebooks on your Read the Docs (or just build them locally) will be included in your project. A sample notebook will be generated and added to your docs as an example.
   * - *Do you want to add a .gitattributes with entries for git-lfs?*
     - Support for large files for use in git. This option is primarily informational and no answer locks you in to using (or not using) git-lfs. Importantly, selecting this option does not install git-lfs for your project (see :doc:`Git_Large_File_Support <../practices/git-lfs>`).


While these choices will provide the initial structure for your project, most 
can be changed later. 
See Copier's `documentation for changing answers to the question <https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/updating/>`_.

After providing answers to the prompts, Copier will hydrate a project template 
and save it in the directory you specified.

Create and activate a new environment
--------------------------------------

.. note::
    This step is optional, but we recommend using virtual environments to better 
    manage different project's dependencies. 
    See Python's `description of virtual environments <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/>`_ 
    for more details.

If you are using `virtual environments <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Virtual-Environment>`_ 
create a new environment with your choice of environment tools (virtualenv, 
conda, etc.) and activate it.

Prepare your project
---------------------

Once your virtual environment has been created and activated run the following
script in your new project directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    >> bash .prepare_project.sh

This script will initialize your local git repository then install the new Python
package in editable mode along with runtime and developer dependencies. Finally
the script will initialize :doc:`pre-commit <../practices/precommit>`.

The full contents of the script can be seen on `Github <https://github.com/lincc-frameworks/python-project-template/tree/main/python-project-template/.prepare_project.sh>`_.

The script assumes that you have access to bash. If that is not true for your environment,
you should be able to run all the commands manually in your environment using
your available shell.

.. tip::
  Projects using Python notebooks will need to have ``pandoc`` installed to 
  convert notebooks to html locally.
  Pandoc is `available on conda-forge <https://github.com/conda-forge/pandoc-feedstock>`_, 
  so conda can be a convenient way to keep these dependencies grouped together.

Commit your new project locally
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commit the project to your local version control like so to see the pre-commit 
checks run.

.. code-block:: bash

    >> git checkout -b initial_branch
    Switched to a new branch 'initial_branch'
    >> git add .
    >> git commit -m 'Initial commit'

Push your work to GitHub
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a new repository in GitHub: (`GitHub How-to <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo>`_)

.. code-block:: bash

    >> git remote add origin https://github.com/<the_remote_project>/<the_remote_repository>
    >> git push origin <local_branch_name>

Notice that when you create a PR in GitHub, a set of tests for Continuous 
Integration starts up to verify that the project can build successfully and 
that all the unit tests pass. Neato!

Great, but don't stop here
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At this point, your new project is hydrated, version controlled and ready for
you to start coding. But there's a lot more that this template has to offer!
Take a look at the :doc:`Best Practices section <../practices/overview>` to learn about
built in pre-commit hooks, GitHub CI, automatic documentation, and more.
