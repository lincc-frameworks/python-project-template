LINCC Frameworks Python Project Template
===============================================================================

This project template codifies LINCC Framework's best practices for python code 
organization, testing, documentation, and automation.
It is meant to help python projects get started quickly and allow the user 
to focus on writing code. 

We think it's really neat, and we hope you do to!

If you find it useful, or have any questions or concerns when using the template,
please :doc:`/source/contact`

.. important:: 
   These instructions assume you are using ``copier`` version 9.1 or newer. Some
   features may not be available in older versions.
