LINCC Frameworks Python Project Template
===============================================================================

This project template codifies LINCC-Framework's best practices for python code organization, testing, documentation, and automation.
It is meant to help new python projects get started quickly, letting the user focus on writing code.
The template takes care of the minutia of directory structures, tool configurations, and automated testing until the user is ready to take over.

`Copier <https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is required to use this template.
Copier is an open source tool that hydrates projects from templates and natively supports updating projects as the original template matures.
It's really neat!
