    Your project "{{ project_name }}" has been created successfully!

    There are a few more manual steps to finish the setup.

    Go to your project directory, create a virtual environment, and run the initialization script:
       $ cd {{ _copier_conf.dst_path }}
       $ python3 -mvenv ~/.virtualenvs/{{ project_name }} && source ~/.virtualenvs/{{ project_name }}/bin/activate
       $ bash .prepare_project.sh

    Push your project to a new repository on GitHub:
       $ git remote add origin https://github.com/{{project_organization}}/{{project_name}}.git
       $ git push -u origin main

    {%- if include_notebooks %}

    Install pandoc to build your documentation locally
       $ conda install pandoc
    {%- endif %}

    {%- if "email" in failure_notification %}

    Follow these instructions to set up email notifications:
       https://lincc-ppt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/practices/ci_testing.html#email-notifications
    {%- endif %}

    {%- if "slack" in failure_notification %}

    Follow these instructions to set up slack notifications:
       https://lincc-ppt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/practices/ci_testing.html#slack-notifications
    {%- endif %}

    {%- if include_benchmarks %}

    Follow these instructions to set up benchmarking
       https://lincc-ppt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/practices/ci_benchmarking.html#set-up
    {%- endif %}

    Finally, a few items to consider:
       - Set up branch protection rules in github
       - Enable dependabot in github
       - Add another GitHub user as an administrator on the repository
