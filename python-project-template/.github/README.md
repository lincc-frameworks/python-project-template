# The .github directory

This directory contains various configurations and .yml files that are used to
define GitHub actions and behaviors.

## Workflows

The .yml files in ``./workflows`` are used to define the various continuous 
integration scripts that will be run on your behalf e.g. nightly as a smoke check,
or when you create a new PR.

For more information about CI and workflows, look here: https://lincc-ppt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/practices/ci.html

## Configurations

Templates for various different issue types are defined in ``./ISSUE_TEMPLATE``
and a pull request template is defined as ``pull_request_template.md``. Adding,
removing, and modifying these templates to suit the needs of your project is encouraged.

For more information about these templates, look here: https://lincc-ppt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/practices/issue_pr_templating.html
