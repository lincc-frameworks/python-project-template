# This workflow publishes a benchmarks comment on a pull request. It is triggered after the
# benchmarks are computed in the asv-pr workflow. This separation of concerns allows us limit
# access to the target repository private tokens and secrets, increasing the level of security.
# Based on https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/.
